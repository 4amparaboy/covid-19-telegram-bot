# COVID-19 Worldwide Statistics Bot for Telegram

> *The Prophet (ï·º) said, "If you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; but if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it, do not leave that place."*

~~Here is the bot: [@COVID19WorldwideStatisticsBot](https://t.me/COVID19WorldwideStatisticsBot)~~ **The bot is no longer running or maintained.**

A Telegram Bot that sends you a notification when the statistics of a country you subscribed to gets updated.

Statistics are fetched from [disease.sh](https://github.com/disease-sh/API "NovelCovid/API Github page")

<hr>

### **What works?:**
* Listing countries
* Saving user subscriptions
* Sending update messages

### **Issues:**
* ~~Unsubscription doesn't work~~ I found a workaround, although it might not be the best way to solve. See [this commit](https://github.com/memreyagci/covid-19-telegram-bot/commit/db96e57037b958c3c827e329679a09bc9711f032 "commit db96e57037b958c3c827e329679a09bc9711f032").
* Antarctica button doesn't work. Nothing happens but the appearance of the loading symbol when its clicked.
